## Key Features

### 1. Creating and Managing Blog Posts
- Authors can create, edit, and delete posts via the Django admin interface or directly through the blog interface.

### 2. Full-text Search
- The blog application includes a full-text search functionality. This allows users to search for specific keywords in blog posts using PostgreSQL’s `search` feature.

### 3. User Comments
- Registered users can comment on individual posts. Comments are linked to specific posts and displayed underneath each post.

### 4. Pagination
- Blog posts are paginated, meaning that the main blog page will display a limited number of posts per page, with navigation controls for additional pages.

## Usage

- **Homepage**: Displays a list of blog posts with pagination.
- **Post Detail Page**: Clicking on a blog post will show its details, including comments.
- **Search**: A search bar allows users to search for blog posts by title or content.
- **Admin Panel**: The Django admin panel provides access for the superuser to manage posts, comments, and users.
